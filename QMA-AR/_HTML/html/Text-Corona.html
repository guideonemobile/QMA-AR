	<h1>Corona &ndash; Queens</h1>
	
	<p>Situated just northwest of Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Corona is a New York City neighborhood that’s about as dynamic as they come. With the construction of the railroad in the mid-1800s, Corona transformed from a quaint rural village to a rapidly developed residential community. Today, Corona offers an eclectic mix of people and culture, with its population representing the kind of international diversity that has made Queens famous the world over. Aside from offering a delicious range of Latin American, Italian, and Asian cuisine, the neighborhood is also home to some of the city’s most beloved cultural museums such as the Queens Museum, the New York Hall of Science, and the Louis Armstrong House. </p>
