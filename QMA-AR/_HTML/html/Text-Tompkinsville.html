	<h1>Tompkinsville &ndash; St.George, Staten Island</h1>
	
	<p>Located in the northeastern section of Staten Island, Tompkinsville was famous during colonial times for its fresh spring water. Today the neighborhood boasts an active literary and arts scene while at the same time fostering one of the largest Sri Lankan communities outside of Sri Lanka. Silver Lake Park, built as a response to Manhattanâ€™s Central Park, is a 209-acre park that offers residents a range of recreational facilities, from biking paths to an 18-hole golf course.</p>
