	<h1>Woodside &ndash; Queens</h1>
	
	<p>Stand in Tower Square, on the corner of Woodside Avenue and Northern Boulevard, and consider that this used to be site of the former trolley terminal for the Queens County Railway; before the subway system, it was the trolley that dominated as the cityâ€™s public transportation. Now although the city has long since moved on from trolleys, Woodside has continued to grow into a quaint, but energetic Queens neighborhood. Initially developed as a rural respite for the wealthy, Woodside today is home to a diverse population that seems to specialize in that small town/big city feel.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Real estate developer, Benjamin Hitchcock, developed the area in 1867, laying out streets and lots.</li>
		<li>Woodside is home to Topaz Arts, a multidisciplinary arts organization whose mission is to support and exhibit works by performance and visual artists.</li>
	</ul>
