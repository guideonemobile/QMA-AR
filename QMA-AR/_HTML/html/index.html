<h1>About the Artist and the Traveling Exhibition</h1>
<p>In 1977, Romare Bearden (1911-1988), one of the most powerful and original artists of the 20th century, created a series of collages and watercolors based on Homer’s epic poem, <i>The Odyssey</i>.</p>

<a href="video:info.m4v"><img class="video-thumb" src="img/video-thumb.png"  width="215" height="172" /></a>

<p>Born in Charlotte, N.C., Bearden moved with his family to Harlem as a young child, part of the Great Migration of African Americans from the inhospitable South to greater opportunity in the North. Throughout his career, Bearden created images of the lives of travelers on their way to and from home, a theme no more powerfully explored than in his Odyssey series. Bearden had examined classical themes before, but <i>The Odyssey</i> series expanded his exploration of literary narratives and artistic genres by presenting his own personal reinterpretation of the subject.</p>

<p>Rich in symbolism and allegorical content, Bearden’s Odyssey series created an artistic bridge between classical mythology and African American culture. The works conveyed a sense of timelessness and the universality of the human condition, but their brilliance was displayed for only two months in New York City before being scattered to private collections and public art museums. </p>

<p>An engaging exhibition from the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) represents the first full-scale presentation of these works outside of New York City. <b>“Romare Bearden: A Black Odyssey”</b> will embark on a seven-city national tour through 2014. <a href="http://sites.si.edu/romarebearden/visit">Check our website</a> for tour details.</p>

<p>Curated by Robert G. O’Meally, the Zora Neale Hurston Professor of English and Comparative Literature and founder and former director of the Center for Jazz Studies at Columbia University, the exhibition is organized by SITES in cooperation with the Romare Bearden Foundation and Estate and DC Moore Gallery.</p>

<p><b>“Romare Bearden: A Black Odyssey”</b> and its related educational resources are supported by a grant from the Stavros Niarchos Foundation.</p>
